#PA-net

This is my first project, I wanted to learn more about neural networks and how to use them.
This is a collection of code I have written, altough its poorly documented I hope that it'ill be useful for someone.
I used Keras and Tensorflow and the PlaidML library by Vertex.AI to accelerate the training.

the file "mymodel.h5" is the neural network I trained, it had an error rate of approximatly 1%.
